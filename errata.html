<h4>Abelian: A Compiler for Graph Analytics on Distributed, Heterogeneous Platforms</h4>

<p>
The code run for experiments in this paper for the "compiled" code weren't
compiled and were manually written to mimic the code that the compiler would
write. The compiler we had would generate some code, but as far as I remember
it was not able to put the code in the correct place 100% of the time.
However, there was effort put in to mimic what the compiled code would have
looked like in the manual creation of it, so the ideas of the paper still hold
some merit.

<p>
Given my involvement in this code writing, I do not consider this paper as part
of my CV. I only mention it so that I can note the above.

<h4>Efficient Distribution for Deep Learning on Large Graphs</h4>

<p>
The paper found on the GNNSys webpage contains an incorrect appendix:
the learning rates for DGL and DistDGL are not 0.01 in all cases.
DistDGL used 0.003 in our experiments, and DGL used 0.01 in the
experiments except for reddit with GCN which uses 0.02.
</p>

<p>
This has been corrected in the version of the paper posted on my webpage
(unlike the other errors on this page, it is corrected here because this is in
a workshop paper, which is considered non-archival).

<h4>DistTC: High Performance Distributed Triangle Counting</h4>

<p>
The paper mentions that the source code for TriCore was not available during
the time of writing.  The code was indeed public when we published this paper
as we found out after publication.  During writing and experimental results
collction, we had contacted the authors and did a search for the code, but the
authors did not reply nor were not able to find it; this is why the paper says
it is not available.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important Note (originally added 4/12/21):</b>
The triangle counting algorithm in this paper had already existed in past work.
Even though DistTC cites this work, I was not aware that the algorithm in that
paper is essentially the same.

<p>
What DistTC does that is different is that it provides a GPU implementation
compared to the original's CPU implementation. The use of the CuSP partitioner
can also allow for different kinds of edge cuts to be explored more easily than
the original formulation.

<p>
If DistTC is cited in your work, please also cite PATRIC.

<h4>A Round-Efficient Distributed Betweenness Centrality Algorithm</h4>

<p>
There was a correctness bug in MRBC that affected indochina and
rmat24 runs in the paper; with regard to runtimes,
only indochina scaling numbers are significantly different:
using numbers from the corrected version of MRBC
affects the scaling numbers for indochina in the Results section
(1 host indochina runtime is around 5% slower, so scaling to 32 hosts ends up
better if new numbers are used because at scale there is no
significant change with the corrected version).
</p>

<p>
The correct version of MRBC is available on the Galois GitHub.
